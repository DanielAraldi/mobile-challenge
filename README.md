# Team Mobile Capital Technical Challenge

Welcome to Capital!

This test will serve to let us know a little more about your technical skills in application development with React Native. A few days after you finish the challenge (maximum a week), we'll send you feedback with our impressions and a possible invitation to a more detailed conversation about the decisions you made during development.

It is worth remembering that here at Capital we value the quality of our users' experience and the quality of the code we produce. Applying good programming practices is a rule for us ;)

## First steps

Fork this repository, it will be essential for its delivery, which will be by Pull Request.

## The problem

We need to build a brief app to be able to visualize several superheroes! For this we will have an API which you will have to consult and display this data.

## The challenge

It is necessary to build the application from scratch, the code base will be built entirely by you. Remember, the clearer your code and decisions are to our recruiting team, the better you will perform in the assessment. If you need to justify the use of a dependency or some architectural decision, just comment in the body of the submission email (instructions below).

## Layout

Well, we want to understand how your sixth sense is on this, so the layout is entirely up to you as long as you have all the prerequisites for the next session.

## Requirements

#### 1. Home Screen

It should contain a hero listing with a maximum of 10 heroes per page. Yes, we know the API sends you more than that, we need it to solve that ;)

Ah, we need a search field to search for a hero, after all everyone has a favorite. Remember to have a layout for when the search doesn't return results.

#### 2. Hero Details Screen

By clicking on any of the heroes on the home screen we will see more details, such as powers, appearance, biography and occupation. We need you to display this data in the best possible way (text, graphics, images, etc).

## Technical requirements

Use the following technologies:

 - [ ] React Native
 - [ ] TypeScript
 - [ ] NPM
 - [ ] [Airbnb TypeScript Pattern](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb-typescript)


## Assessment

As you can imagine, we will evaluate both the creative capacity of the technical solution (using redux, context, graphql, etc) and the usability of the application. You can feel free to spice up new things.

## Submission

When you're satisfied with your work, just Open a pull Request in the [challenge repository](https://github.com/capitual/mobile-challenge)


Thank you very much for your time and your interest in joining our team!

We sincerely thank you ❤️
